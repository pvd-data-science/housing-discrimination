      "Distinctive features set this traditional Newport cottage apart. With a wrap-around porch, bay window in the dining room, a turret that creates a sunny sitting area in the master bedroom, and original woodwork, this 1920 home has a Victorian-era feel. The front of the house faces south, bringing sunlight to the open living and dining rooms. A large eat-in-kitchen and half bath complete the first floor. A wide staircase begins in the gracious entry hall and opens to a landing/hallway on the second floor. The master bedroom is in the front of the house, with 2 additional bedrooms at the back, and a full bath with tub/shower off the hallway. A mudroom off the kitchen leads to the deck and a surprisingly spacious yard. Great play space, pet space, or enough room for a mini-vegetable farm is between the house and garage. The garage has 2 large bays and a loft space above. Both the house and the garage have recent roofs and the house has recent exterior paint. A long driveway leads to the garage at the rear of the lot, with parking and turnaround space. A great Newport package within easy reach of downtown and just .8 miles to the bridge ramp and shopping."
