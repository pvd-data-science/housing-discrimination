      "I\u2019m subletting my apartment located in the 1Lofts building in Pawtucket, RI. It is a beautiful, 3rd floor, corner, 2 bedroom, unit surrounded by windows on 2 walls. Black out shades on all windows. It is right next to the back elevator, for convenience. You will never hear the elevator, or people, exiting. Dogs and cats are allowed. No breed restrictions, which is unheard of in RI. Dogs will need a muzzle, and choke, at all times, if they tend to lean more towards aggression. Please keep in mind, no fighting dogs will be permitted. No Exceptions! This building has an amazing reputation for having zero dog related issues, and we want to keep it that way. A gated dog park is located towards the rear of the property, should your furry friend need to run and play. Throughout the complex are additional areas for dogs to relieve themselves. You are strictly required to pick up after your pet(s) at all times, mandatory, regardless of weather conditions.",
      "I must relocate due to a family situation, so therefore I am offering my unit, partly furnished, (you decide), to fulfill my lease which runs from February 1st, 2020, through June 30th, 2020. After which you may renew. You must pass a background check, and a credit check, in order to take over the lease. You will not have to come up with a deposit, as I am willing to leave my deposit, for your convenience. If you decide to leave at the end of June 2020, you are entitled to keep the deposit for yourself, provided no damage has come to the unit.",
      "Electric/gas, and internet/cable will be your responsibility. I will be transferring my service elsewhere. Utilities are relatively low due to being located between floors. Cool in summer, warm in winter.",
      "The lease amount is $1,300 + $50 monthly for each pet. Garbage and recycling collection bins are on the premises, and included in lease fee, along with water consumption. Also, available to you, for convenience, is a laundry room in the basement. You will need a reloadable laundry card, which again, I will provide, with a balance of $50. Each load, wash/dry, is $2. Since the elevator is conveniently right next to your unit, lugging clothes to wash and dry, up and down stairs, is not an issue. If you prefer, the unit does come equipped to accommodate a stackable washer/dryer located inside the bathroom in your unit. You would have to purchase this separately as I have not done so.",
      "Please contact at the number provided if/when you would like to see the unit. It is very spacious, and offers much closet space, and very high ceilings. The first bedroom is ground level when you walk in, towards the rear of unit, with a divider wall, a closet, and a door, for privacy. It runs the entire back wall with large windows that are equipped with blackout shades. The 2nd bedroom is up a flight of stairs on a loft space above the kitchen. It also has a closet. There is a railing and you are invited to put up a curtain or divider for privacy. This is also a ideal roommate situation, as both bedrooms are not visible, one to the other.",
      "The building is a 4 story, and although the unit is on the 3rd floor, the neighbor above is very considerate, and quiet. I was reluctant at first, living under someone, since I had a bad experience once, but have had zero issues with noise coming from above.",
      "Parking is gated with a code, very safe,  and there is never a shortage. Entry to building is highly secure utilizing electronic key. Fellow tenants are very courteous, never parking too close, and respectful to each other\u2019s vehicles. Mail is central, located at the front entrance, with a mail key for each assigned mailbox. One will be provided. Packages can be delivered via any carrier, which are brought directly into the building. I have had many deliveries here without any issues. This dwelling houses very honest, polite, working class, people.",
      "You can see a virtual tour of the actual vacant unit at:",
      "\u201c1Lofts in Pawtucket|Virtual Tour|The Shaftesbury\u201d",
      "This should give you a very good idea of the actual size, and look, of the unit.",
      "I will deliver the unit to you exceptionally clean, all floors, entire kitchen & bathroom, refrigerator, dishwasher, and stove, all in working order/condition. I have a dog, Pit bull, so I will ensure that no pet odors, or residues, will remain. Smoking is permitted only outside areas of the building. Dispose of appropriately; no throwing of butts on the grounds."
