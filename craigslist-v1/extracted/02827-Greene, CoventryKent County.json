      "Hello. 34 year old M looking for caretaking role in exchange for an onsite living situation anywhere in RI. Experienced landscaper, farmer, beekeeper, bee and wasp removal, online sales (managing webstore, packing and shipping, carbon fiber sports gear assembly), dog and cat sitting+walking, basic carpentry, masonry and painting experience. I love working with plants, animals and of course bees! Ideally I'm looking for an opportunity with enough work trade to stay on site for free, though I'm also willing to pay reduced rent in exchange for services. Not a drinker/or smoker, I have a cat. I'm quick to pick up new skills and a diligent worker with many references. Also willing to work as a security guard. Thanks."
