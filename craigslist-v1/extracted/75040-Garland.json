Everyday meal prep is simple as the kitchen comes with stainless steel appliances and granite countertops. In addition to a utility closet, the en-suite bathroom has a wardrobe. Outside your apartment, you have access to a gorgeous courtyard where a fire pit and grilling stations are available. Make the most of a pleasant day by swimming in the resort-style pool, reading on the sundeck, or spending time with your dogs at the pet park. Request a tour now!",
