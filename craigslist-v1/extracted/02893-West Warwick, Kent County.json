You have to walk down a flight of stairs to get to the front door. The house is on a large fenced-in lot. There is only one off-street parking spot, but we could squeeze in a second car in the event of a snowstorm where you can\u2019t park on the street. Please no dogs, we would consider a cat. Absolutely no smoking in the apartment.",

We also have a pug that is very friendly who would be out in the yard at times. Please email me with a little about yourself and your phone number so we can arrange a time for a phone interview. This is a very unique private apartment. Prospective tenants will be required to undergo a criminal background and credit check for $45 per adult that will be on the lease. Lease period is 1 year. References are required and will be checked."
