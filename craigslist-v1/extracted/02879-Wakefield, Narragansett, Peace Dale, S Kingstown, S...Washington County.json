I'm posting on here for more options on housing maybe someone will find me and think we are perfect for their home, I am 29yrs old and my girls are 2 and 5 and my sister is 20. I work full time and my kids go to school and daycare and my sister goes to school. Hopefully I get a few response's but I have also reached out to local realtors in my search. I know I'm looking early in the year but I want to make sure when my lease is up we have a better place to go. Please e-mail or text my phone I don't answer random numbers due to all the spam calls I receive, if you leave a message I will respond or e-mail you back!"
