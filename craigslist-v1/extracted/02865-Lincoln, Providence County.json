      "This property is one of the most unique properties you can find on the rental market. On the surface it's a 3 bed/ 1.2 bath (1 full bath, 2 half bath) home boasting roughly 1500 square feet but it's so much more than that! This home sits far off the main road, allowing for access to highways and shopping while also providing the feeling of being lost in the woods (13+ acres!) that make up the property. The land is beautifully landscaped with a horse barn, fenced pasture, open back yard (approx 1 acre, poster's estimation) and lots of woods to hike through. Inside the home features a wood burning fire place, newly redone bathrooms, and TONS of natural light. The number \"1500 sq feet\" does not do this home justice as it has an open layout main living level with two huge bedrooms, including a true master, upstairs.",
