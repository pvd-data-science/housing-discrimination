      "Hello, My family and I are unfortunately, having to move out of our home we have been renting for 4/5 years. A new Landlord took over after the death of my last one and wants to just sell the place. But their are numerous problems with the property that need fixing while also having tenants , I assume is a headache and just makes it harder to sell. So come May 2020 they will not re-new our lease. We are looking for something in a decent area that have good schools for our children to attend. 2/3/4 bedrooms. If we have to take a two bedroom we will, we live in a 2 bedroom house now but converted the closed in dining area into a bedroom. We are a close knit family and are respectful, quiet tenants other than the normal toddler noises. Lol :) We also have 2 cats that are litter boxed trained. Looking for something affordable, 1400 at the most ! Please contact me through here if you may be able to help. Thank you and Happy Holidays !"
