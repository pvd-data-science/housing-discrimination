      "Dogs, cats, fish, rabbits and any pet welcomed. Out the window, you have excellent view directly at the park and the beautiful armory castle. Snow plowing early in the morning so unfortunately you do not have an excuse to be late for work!! There are activities at the park during the summer months with concerts, dog walks, baseball and soccer games. A farmer\u2019s market across the street with fresh local fruits and vegetables. You can stock up for the week so that you do not have to go to the supermarket and buy unripe produce from other countries. Off street privet parking. Garden in the back of the house to plant your own vegetables. Clean, quite and safe. I can show it to you as soon as you call me. Sam",
